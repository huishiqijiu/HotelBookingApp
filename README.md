# HotelBookingApp

This is a simple web hotel-booking system built with MVC. Registered user can log in and book different types of rooms. After submitting the booking, user will receive an email with payment information. 

The system will check if bookings have been paid no later than 10 days prior to the check-in date and automatically delete those unpaid bookings with a notification emailed to the user.
